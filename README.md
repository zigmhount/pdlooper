# pdlooper

Pdlooper is a looping software, typically used in live setups (but not only), with audio and MIDI support. It is written in [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) - [Purr Data](https://github.com/agraef/purr-data) actually, though I'm trying to limit the number of externals used.   
I've been trying out open-source looping software for a while and could not find exactly what I was looking for. I have pretty much no skills in "proper" programming languages so I didn't really have the possibility (unfortunately) to improve any of the tools I've tried, so I decided to build my own from scratch.  
Not sure whether this will actually be usable (especially in terms of real-time performance) but it's at least fun to learn!

## Usage concept
Like the tools I was inspired by (see below), I intend to use Pdlooper in a modular setup, involving for example:
- physical MIDI controllers (control surface such as Akai APCs, Novation Launchpads, Ableton Push), including some knobs and faders
- MIDI keyboard(s)
- Software synthesizers (Fluidsynth, ZynAddSubFx/Zyn-Fusion, Helm, Calf suite's synths...)
- Mixer (Non-Mixer, jack_mixer, Ardour)
- Lv2 plugin host for synths and effects (Carla, Ardour, Non-Mixer)

## Current features
- Record audio loops
- Play audio loops
- Set tempo by tapping
- Controllable via MIDI controller (I use an AKAI APC Mini with 8*8 buttons) including outgoing MIDI message to light up the controller's LEDs
- Save loops as wav files
- select the output channels for each loop

## Current issues
- Short freeeze when starting to record, pretty bad.
- Can't easily load saved files

## Planned features
- File management
  - Save session file
  - Load session file and wav files as loops
- Make recording and playing actually stereo (i.e. add an array for each loop)
- Control loops
  - groups/scenes of loops to be started at once
  - automatic set of loops following each other (incl random)
- More looping
  - loops for midi controls
  - loops for midi sequences?
- Fancy stuff
  - include knobs and faders in the UI to make it a single interface between my physical controllers and mixers/plugins (rather than connecting the controllers to each mixer/effect host)
  - include lv2 host with [lv2plugin~]?
  - timeline editor to arrange loops (*Ã  la* seq24/seq64)?
  - playlist?
  - support NSM protocol for use with Ray-Session?


## Inspiration
This looper is heavily inspired from Seq24/[Seq64](https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64) and [Luppp](http://openavproductions.com/luppp/)/[Loopp](https://git.netzspielplatz.de/soundship/loopp), and takes some ideas from [FreeWheeling](https://github.com/free-wheeling/freewheeling) and [SuperBoucle](https://github.com/Vampouille/superboucle), and probably others I don't remember (and some other well-known commercial software).
